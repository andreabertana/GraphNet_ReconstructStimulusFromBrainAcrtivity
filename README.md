# GraphNet_ReconstructStimulusFromBrainAcrtivity

A bunch of codes and simulations for a model that I developed using GraphNet to reconstrut
the stimulus that was presented to observers from brain activity measured with fMRI.

Data is not provided, so only simulation scripts can be used and present.

Details of the model and project can be found in:

- pRF model inversion (This document outlines a proposal for estimating the neural 
activation profile in visual space that caused a certain pattern of voxel responses, by inverting the pRF model)

- Stimulus Decoding Math (It explains the generative model used and the math behind it)

- CorticalMechanismOfPl_Overview (a presentation used to give an overview of the project and how we used the model)
